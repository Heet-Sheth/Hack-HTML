    <h3>Principle 1: The Need to Share Information &amp; The Problem of Scale</h3>

    <p>
        The most fundamental challenge is getting information from one computer to another.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>The Problem:</strong> How can we send data between two computers that are not in the same room?
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Solution (Physical Transfer):</strong> The most basic method is to use a physical
                    device like a pen drive to copy data from one machine and paste it onto another. This works, but
                    it's manual, slow, and doesn't scale.</li>
                <li><strong>A Better Solution (Direct Connection):</strong> A more efficient approach is to connect the
                    two computers with a wire, like an Ethernet cable. This allows for direct, electronic data transfer.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The Problem of Scale:</strong> A direct connection fails when you add many computers. Connecting
            every machine to every other machine directly is physically impossible and requires too many ports.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solution 1 (The Local Network):</strong> To solve this, we use a central device called a
                    <strong><a
                            href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-a-network-switch-and-how-does-it-work/">Switch</a></strong>.
                    All computers in a local area connect to this single switch,
                    which forwards
                    messages to the correct destination. This creates an efficient <strong><a

                            (LAN)</a></strong>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Solution 2 (The Internet):</strong> To solve the problem of connecting different LANs (e.g.,
                    one office network to another), we use a special device called a <strong><a
                            href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/introduction-of-a-router/">Router</a></strong>.
                    A router's
                    job is to connect different networks and route traffic between them. The <strong>Internet</strong>
                    is fundamentally a "network of networks"—millions of private and public LANs all connected by
                    routers.</li>

    <h3>Principle 2: The Problem of Identity &amp; Addressing</h3>
    <img src="./ip.png" alt="packet with sender and receiver ip address" width="400px">
    <img src="./ipv4_vs_ipv6.png" alt="IPV4 vs IPV6" width="400px">
    <p>
        In a global web of millions of devices, we need a universal addressing system to find a specific computer. This
        led to the creation of several types of addresses, each solving a unique problem.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-science-fundamentals/what-is-an-ip-address/">IP Address</a> (The
        "Where To" Address)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> How do we send a message to a specific device among millions? We need a unique
            address for every device on the network.</li>
        <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> The <strong>IP (Internet Protocol) Address</strong>. It’s a unique numerical
            label assigned to each device, allowing data to be routed to it. There are two versions:
            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-ipv4/">IPv4</a></strong>:
                    The classic format, which is a <strong>32-bit</strong> number written as four
                    decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., <code>192.168.1.8</code>). This system is limited to about
                    <strong>4.3 billion</strong> unique addresses. We have run out of available IPv4 addresses because
                    the number of internet-connected devices far exceeds this limit.
                </li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-ipv6/">IPv6</a></strong>:
                    The next generation, created to solve the address shortage. It is a
                    <strong>128-bit</strong> number written in hexadecimal format (e.g.,
                    <code>2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334</code>). This provides a virtually inexhaustible number of
                    addresses (340 undecillion).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Public vs. Private IP Addresses</h4>
    <img src="./privateIP.png" alt="Private and Public IP address" width="600px">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> The shortage of IPv4 addresses meant we couldn't give a unique, global address
            to every single device.</li>
        <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> A clever workaround was to create two types of IP addresses.
            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-public-ip-address/">Public
                            IP</a>:</strong> A globally unique address assigned to your network's router by your
                    Internet Service Provider (ISP). Think of this as your company's main, public phone number. It must
                    be unique across the entire internet.</li>
                <li><strong><a
                            href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/private-ip-addresses-in-networking/">Private
                            IP</a>:</strong> A local-only address used within your private network (e.g., your home
                    Wi-Fi). Think of this as an employee's internal 4-digit extension number. These addresses only need
                    to be unique on your local network and are reused in millions of other homes and offices. The most
                    common range for home networks is <code>192.168.0.0</code> to <code>192.168.255.255</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/mac-address-in-computer-network/">MAC Address</a> (The
        "Who Exactly" Address)</h4>
    <img src="./mac.png" alt="macc address included in the packets" width="600px">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> IP addresses are often temporary and dynamic; they can be taken away when you
            disconnect and reassigned to someone else. This creates a massive security flaw: if a server's reply is
            delayed, your sensitive data could be sent to a different device that was assigned your old IP address.</li>
        <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> The <strong>MAC (Media Access Control) Address</strong>. It is a
            <strong>permanent, 48-bit</strong> physical serial number burned into a device's network hardware by the
            manufacturer. It cannot be changed or taken away.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Function:</strong> Data packets include both the IP and MAC addresses. This ensures that
                    even if an IP is reassigned, the data is only delivered to the device with the correct, matching MAC
                    address, preventing misdelivery.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple MAC Addresses:</strong> A single device has multiple MAC addresses—one for each way
                    it can transfer data (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, AirDrop).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-ports-in-networking/">Port Numbers </a> (The
        "Which App" Address)</h4>
    <img src="./port.png" alt="port address is also included" width="600px">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Data arrives at the correct computer (thanks to IP and MAC), but the computer
            is running multiple applications (e.g., browser tabs for YouTube, Instagram, etc.). How does the device know
            which specific application should receive the data?.</li>
        <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> The <strong>Port Number</strong>. It's a numerical identifier that directs
            network traffic to the correct service on a machine. It is a <strong>16-bit unsigned integer</strong>,
            ranging from 0 to 65535.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Well-Known Ports (0-1023):</strong> Reserved for standard services like <strong>HTTP (port
                        80)</strong> and <strong>HTTPS (port 443)</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Registered Ports (1024-49151):</strong> For specific applications, like <strong>MongoDB
                        (port 27017)</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic/Ephemeral Ports (49152-65535):</strong> Used for temporary, client-side connections,
                    like when your browser makes a request.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Principle 3: Using Names Instead of Numbers</h3>
    <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250305144138434598/dns-image.png"
        alt="working of a DNS" width="600px">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Humans are good at remembering names (like <code>google.com</code>) but bad at
            remembering long strings of numbers (IP addresses). We need a system to translate the names we use into the
            addresses computers need.</li>
        <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> The <strong><a
                    href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/">DNS
                    (Domain Name System)</a></strong>. It acts like the phonebook of
            the internet, translating human-friendly domain names into computer-friendly IP addresses.</li>
        <li><strong>The DNS Lookup Process:</strong> When you type a domain name, your computer follows a hierarchical
            search to find the IP address:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Local Cache:</strong> First, your computer checks its own cache (browser, OS) to see if it
                    already knows the IP.</li>
                <li><strong>Recursive Resolver:</strong> If not found locally, it asks a DNS Resolver (usually from your
                    ISP). This server promises to do all the work to find the final answer.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Server:</strong> The resolver asks one of the 13 logical Root Servers, which points it
                    to the correct server for the top-level domain (like <code>.com</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>TLD Server:</strong> The resolver then asks the Top-Level Domain (TLD) server (e.g., the
                    <code>.com</code> server), which points it to the server that is the final authority for that
                    specific domain.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Authoritative Name Server:</strong> Finally, the resolver asks the domain's Authoritative
                    Name Server, which holds the actual IP address and provides the final answer.</li>
                <li><strong>Response:</strong> The answer travels back to your computer, getting cached along the way to
                    speed up future requests.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
